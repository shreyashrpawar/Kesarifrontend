A destination wedding in India is an experience like no other. India is a place that stereotypes and cliches can‘t describe. While it comes with its share of challenges, finding the perfect venue, coordinating with 100+ vendors, and having a story to tell for a lifetime makes every ounce of effort and pain worth it! We have curated everything you need to know about our country for your dream destination wedding. 
Here's how to get your mind around the country's unique customs and traditions, as well as what to wear, pack and expect from your guest list, and a popular choice when planning one!


##### Know your budget and prioritize the guest list:


The first step in planning a destination wedding is to know your budget and prioritize the guest list.

Before you begin planning, set aside time to sit down with your fiancé(e) and figure out how much money you must spend on your wedding. From there, you can work backward from that number to determine what things that may be important but not necessarily expensive — like a honeymoon or getting married at an open park/garden or beach — could be sacrificed for other items such as an elaborate reception.

While it's ideal to have all of your guests in one place at once, it's also important to consider where they're coming from and how far away, they live from each other. For example, if one family lives in Mumbai City while another lives in Pune City, it might make sense for them to travel together rather than requiring everyone to fly across the country on short notice.


##### Send Save the Dates in Advance

First things first: If you're planning a destination wedding, it's important to send out your save the dates at least three months before your big day. 

That way, guests will have plenty of time to RSVP and plan their travel plans. Additionally, it's important that you send out plenty of save the dates because the more people who know about your wedding, the less stressful it will be for everyone involved.



##### Set Up Fun Activities for Guests

Another way to make your guests feel special is by hosting fun activities for them during their visit. For example, if your venue has a pool or spa, host an afternoon swim party or a poolside cocktail party where they can relax while they wait for showtime. If there are any local restaurants or bars with happy hours or other specials that come around during this time period, do some research and find out when those happen so that you can offer something similar for your guests.



##### Get creative with your wedding venue

There are so many options when it comes to choosing a venue for your wedding day for example in Goa or Rajasthan - You can opt for an open-air beachfront or even a castle if you have a little extra money to spend on your big day!

However, if you want to have fun without breaking the bank - familiarize yourself with the area you're getting married in. Choosing an area where you're familiar with will make everything easier for you as well as your guests who may not know much about this part of India or even India itself! You'll also be able to spend more time with each other on your special day instead of having to run around looking for things all day long!

If you don’t have the time or license to get creative with your wedding venue, consider speaking with our executives.
