What could be more romantic than saying "I do" amidst the sand between your toes, breezy coastal winds and the soft humming of the sea waves? Goa is the perfect destination for such a once in a lifetime event with beautiful locations with its ever-irresistible charm!

Goa is a popular destination with couples, who are looking to get married in India. It is surrounded with everything you need for a memorable wedding -- starting from beaches and sandy backwaters, all the way through different luxury hotels and exclusive resorts. The distance between Goa and other states is also less than that between any other state in India. If you've been planning an intimate beach wedding or a large multi-cultural wedding, you are sure to find something that suits your needs.

The most underrated aspect about the susegaad state is that most of its old Portuguese architecture still remains in pristine condition. It's also a place where your extended family can enjoy everything from water sports, nightlife and so much more!
